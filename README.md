We pulled data sets from Kaggle on the World Happiness Report based off the Gallup World Poll. This includes two CSV files, one with happiness data from 2005-2020, and one with happiness data from 2021. We transformed the data sets (adding and removing columns as needed) and joined them into a single database from which to perform queries.
